## Research Interests

- Marine communication
- Maritime target awareness and analysis
- Marine environment awareness and analysis

The key technologies of Marine observation platform were studied. The application of satellite remote sensing data in ship monitoring, the application of spaceborne AIS data in ship monitoring, the application of information technology in Marine oil spill detection, and the application of information technology in Marine water pollution monitoring were analyzed by combining fixed observation network, motorized stereo observation and unmanned ocean observation. The fast recognition of Marine target information is studied, the time and space obstacles in the process of Marine information aggregation are eliminated, and the synchronization and fusion methods and technologies of shore-based data and maritime observation data are realized. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of fixed observation pivots are studied. This paper studies the implementation of data acquisition, intelligent information analysis and processing, and Beidou short message data transmission based on shipboard information acquisition platform.
Collect relevant research data. Collect basic geographic information, Marine environment monitoring information, sea area and island management information and other basic data. The data of pH, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, suspended matter, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrite nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, reactive phosphate, petroleum, heavy metals and other elements of seawater in the concerned area were collected. Collect the hydrodynamic environment data (tidal level, tidal current, velocity, direction) of the concerned area.
The architecture of Marine big data service platform was studied. This paper studies the overall planning of Marine data resources currently distributed in different departments, forms a catalogue of Marine information resources, and studies how to realize the collection, storage, processing, analysis, application and sharing of Marine big data resources. Research on information resource planning, database design, Marine data acquisition system design, Marine data access scheme, Marine data engine system design, Marine data governance, and Marine data service system planning.
Explore the application of smart ocean in multiple directions. Study the application of Marine information technology in the direction of Marine disaster prevention and reduction, fishery safety production, aquatic products, Marine fishery administrative law enforcement, Marine emergency rescue, Marine ecological protection, Marine science and culture tourism, and Marine industry development.
