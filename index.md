## Research Interests
- Marine communication
- Maritime target awareness and analysis
- Marine environment awareness and analysis

Collect relevant research data. Collect basic geographic information, Marine environment monitoring information, sea area and island management information and other basic data. The data of pH, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, suspended matter, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrite nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, reactive phosphate, petroleum, heavy metals and other elements of seawater in the concerned area were collected. Collect the hydrodynamic environment data (tidal level, tidal current, velocity, direction) of the concerned area.
The architecture of Marine big data service platform was studied. This paper studies the overall planning of Marine data resources currently distributed in different departments, forms a catalogue of Marine information resources, and studies how to realize the collection, storage, processing, analysis, application and sharing of Marine big data resources. Research on information resource planning, database design, Marine data acquisition system design, Marine data access scheme, Marine data engine system design, Marine data governance, and Marine data service system planning.
Explore the application of smart ocean in multiple directions. Study the application of Marine information technology in the direction of Marine disaster prevention and reduction, fishery safety production, aquatic products, Marine fishery administrative law enforcement, Marine emergency rescue, Marine ecological protection, Marine science and culture tourism, and Marine industry development.
